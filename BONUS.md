# Getting Started with Automated Testing and Authorization

When it comes to automating tests that involve activities requiring authorization it's crucial that the test scripts can authenticate themselves and get the necessary permissions to go through with the action. 

### Secure Storage of Authentication Credentials

First things first, keep authentication details (think API keys or tokens) under lock and key.<br />
We wouldn't want these getting “cozy”‚ in the source code - we stash them in environment variables or secure vaults instead.<br />
This way, they're safe and sound, and code stays clean.

### Automating Token Retrieval

If we are dealing with an API that's all about token-based auth, we are going to want to set up a utility method to automatically fetch a token before the tests execution, `@BeforeAll` method is a good place to use it.<br />
We need to make sure this helper can deal with tokens that are expire by grabbing fresh ones as needed which should be also a part of the test setup.

### Adding Authorization Headers

Got your token? Great! Now we need to use it to add Authorization Headers to our API requests.<br />
If you're using Java with Rest Assured, it goes like this:

```
given().
  contentType(ContentType.JSON).
  accept(ContentType.JSON).
  header("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken).
  header("Api-User-Agent", appName + " (" + yourEmailOrContact + ")").
  body("{\n" +
          "    \"source\": \"Hello, world!\",\n" +
          "    \"title\": \"User:" + yourUsername + "/Sandbox\",\n" +
          "    \"comment\": \"Creating a test page with the Wikimedia API\",\n" +
          "    \"content_model\": \"wikitext\"\n" +
          "}").
when().
    post("/page");

```

### Testing Authorization Logic

We also should include tests to verify that unauthorized requests are properly handled and return the expected error codes and messages.

# Other Aspects to Test in the Public Wikipedia API

There's a bunch more we should test to ensure it's not just functional but a fortress of reliability, security, and user-friendliness:

### Rate Limiting and Throttling:
- Test how the API behaves under heavy load and ensure that rate limiting is in place to prevent abuse.
- This can be done by sending a burst of requests and verifying that the API starts returning rate-limit errors.

### Input Validation and Sanitization:
- Ensure that the API properly validates and sanitizes input to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- This involves sending potentially malicious input and verifying that the API handles it safely.

### Error Handling and Messaging:
- Test the API's response to invalid requests to ensure that error messages are informative but don't reveal sensitive information that could be exploited.

### Content Creation and Modification Endpoints:
- Test the full lifecycle of content – creating, updating, deleting.
- This verifies that changes are correctly applied and that unauthorized modifications are prevented.

### Data Consistency and Integrity:
- After user had his fun creating and modifying content, double-check to make sure everything's exactly where user left it, ensuring the data tells the same story that is intended.

### Performance Testing:
- Nobody likes waiting. Test how the API holds up under normal and heavy loads to ensure it keeps its cool and serves up data without breaking a sweat.

### Security Audits:
- Bring in the experts or conduct our own security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as insecure endpoints, weak encryption, or susceptibility to attacks like Denial of Service (DoS).

### Documentation and Usability Testing:
- An API is only as good as its manual. Test the API documentation for accuracy and completeness. Ensure that the API is user-friendly and that the documentation makes it easy for developers to understand and use the API effectively.

### Versioning Strategy:
- Test the API's versioning strategy to ensure that changes do not break existing clients and that version transitions are smooth and well-documented.
